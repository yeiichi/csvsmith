# The csvsmith Manifesto

1. CSVs deserve tools that are simple, predictable, and transparent.  
2. A row has meaning only when its identity is stable and hashable.  
3. Collisions are sin; determinism is virtue.  
4. Let no delimiter sow ambiguity among fields.  
5. **Love thy `\x1f`.**  
   The unseen separator, the quiet guardian of clean hashes.  
   Chosen not for aesthetics, but for truth.  
6. The pipeline should be silent unless something is wrong.  
7. Your data deserves respect — and your tools should help you give it.
